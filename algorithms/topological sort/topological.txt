In discrete mathematics. We have posets in which not all elements are linked to others.

we convert posets(partially ordered sets) to totally ordered sets using topological sorting

each step of the way u take out the minimal element from the poset and add it to the top of another list

this new list now contains the correct order


This approach is fundamental in various applications, such as task scheduling, dependency
resolution, and ensuring a consistent order in scenarios where not all elements have a direct relationship with one another.
