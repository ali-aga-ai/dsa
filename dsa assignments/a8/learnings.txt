whwen referring to select it means generally selecting the ith smallest element

to get INT_MIN or INT_MAX gotta import limits.h



whenever you create a struct........say a struct of a stack, you must pass pointer of stack object as an arhument is pop() per se
this is because when i create a Stack object as.........struct Stack stack = malloc..........

the object is stored in a mem locn
it has an array and a top element associated with it

so if u do pop(struct Stack stack)........this would be like passing a stack value which isnt the case
if you do pop(struct Stack *stack)........you are pasing a pointer to an object
