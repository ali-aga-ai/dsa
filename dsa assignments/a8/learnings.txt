whwen referring to select it means generally selecting the ith smallest element

to get INT_MIN or INT_MAX gotta import limits.h



whenever you create a struct........say a struct of a stack, you must pass pointer of stack object as an arhument is pop() per se
this is because when i create a Stack object as.........struct Stack stack = malloc..........

the object is stored in a mem locn
it has an array and a top element associated with it

so if u do pop(struct Stack stack)........this would be like passing a stack value which isnt the case
if you do pop(struct Stack *stack)........you are pasing a pointer to an object 


Deque:
    A deque is an extension of a queue that allows elements to be added or removed from both ends.
    
    It supports two-sided access: you can add or remove elements from either the front or the rear.

    Besides enqueue and dequeue, a deque also provides operations like push_front (add to the front) and pop_back (remove from the rear).

    Deques are useful when you need efficient access to both ends of the data structure.
    
    For example, they are commonly used in implementing algorithms like sliding window problems or maintaining a window of fixed size over 
    a stream of data.
