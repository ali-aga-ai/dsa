Yes, that statement is correct. 
The GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP) provides a set of functions for performing basic arithmetic operations 
(addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on integers and rational numbers with arbitrary precision. 
It allows you to work with numbers that can be much larger than those supported by standard data types in languages like C and C++.
