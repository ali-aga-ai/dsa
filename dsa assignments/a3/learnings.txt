in general if there are things where u have to do anything with 'CONSECUTIVE' elements of an array or string, consider window sliding method

window sliding method has O(n) complexity

for pallindrome there is also grow from center method




d.c

sometimes u can be an idiot and apply window sliding when all u needed was two pointer

scanf(" %[^\n]", str); // scan string till u find the first \n, not till u encounter first whitespace..
the above is very important if u wann scan using %s and not for(%c).%s scans all elements(including whitespace) and stores it in str
other wise if u were to do scanf("%s",str) it would simply scan till the first whitespace
