if there are consecutive if statements all of them will be checked 
if1 if2 if3....say if1 is false it doesnt mean if2 and if3 wont be checked
but say if1 else if2....then say if1 is true else will be skipped and if2 will be evaluated
say if else if() if2....say if fails then else if checked if2 is checked regardless
say if elseif1 elseif2....say if fails and elseif1 is valid elseif2 wont be evaluated... 
but say if and elseif1 are both false then elseif2 will be evaluated
a series of if, else if, and optionally, else statements,If the condition in the first if statement is true, 
the subsequent else if and else statements will be skipped entirely,
